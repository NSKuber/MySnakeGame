# MySnakeGame by NSKuber

A simple snake game with gameplay settings and extra lives.

Extra lives allow the player to cross snake's own body at the price of removing the tail and reducing the "current score". 
They do not provide safety against hitting the walls of the game field.

Download and extract "MySnakeGame.zip" for the compiled game with resources.
